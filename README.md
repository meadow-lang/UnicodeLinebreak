# unicodeLinebreak

Find where a line of text may be broken, for
[Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow), using the Line Breaking
Algorithm of [UAX #14](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/).

This package is a port of Rust's
[`unicode-linebreak`](https://github.com/axelf4/unicode-linebreak) 0.1.5 by
Axel Forsman, and covers Unicode 15.0.0. [textwrap](https://github.com/meadow-lang/Baler)
uses it to find where it may break lines.

## AI disclosure

UnicodeLinebreak is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude, through
Claude Code. Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the commit
messages in this repository were written by an agent, under the direction of the
project's author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and rely on
it, with that in mind.

## Install

```sh
meadow add meadow-lang/UnicodeLinebreak
```

## Use

```meadow
use UnicodeLinebreak (linebreaks, breakProperty, BreakClass)

def main =
  ( linebreaks "a b \nc",
    -- [(2, Allowed), (5, Mandatory), (6, Mandatory)]
    breakProperty 0x2CF3 == BreakClass.Alphabetic
  )
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `linebreaks s` | every break opportunity in `s`, as `(offset, Allowed or Mandatory)`. The offset is the byte where the next line would start. The end of a non-empty string always counts as a mandatory break. |
| `breakProperty cp` | the line break class (`BreakClass`) of the code point `cp` |
| `splitAtSafe s` | splits `s` into `(before, after)` at the last point where breaking can restart without looking back. This saves re-scanning the whole string when a long line needs its breaks recomputed near the end. |
| `unicodeVersion` | `(15, 0, 0)` |

`BreakOpportunity`'s constructors, `Allowed` and `Mandatory`, are exported
bare. `BreakClass`'s constructors are written `BreakClass.Alphabetic` and so
on, unless you `use UnicodeLinebreak.BreakClass.*`.

As in the crate, Complex-Context Dependent characters (Thai, Lao, Khmer, …)
are treated as ordinary letters. Finding breaks inside words in those scripts
needs a dictionary, and this package has none.

## How it's made

- **`src/Tables.mw`** is generated from the crate. It holds the class of every
  code point and the crate's pair table, which encodes the whole algorithm as
  a state machine.
- **`src/Break.mw`** translates the few lines of the crate's `lib.rs` that run
  that state machine.
- **`src/Cases.mw`** is generated test data: 4,606 strings built from
  characters of every class, plus some real text. The expected break
  opportunities and `splitAtSafe` results come from calling the crate itself,
  and `meadow test` checks that this port matches.

To regenerate, update the version pin in `scripts/generate/Cargo.toml` and run
`scripts/generate.sh`. It needs a Rust toolchain. If the crate's `lib.rs` has
changed, the generator stops so that `src/Break.mw` can be checked against it
first.
